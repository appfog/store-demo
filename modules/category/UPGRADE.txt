Drupal 6.x:
 * "create categories", "create containers", "edit all categories", and "edit own categories" permissions are gone.
   Categories and containers no longer are special node types. Use the regular set of node permissions in the "node" section
   to control access.

 * The category_display module now depends on category_menu. For some displays (such as the TOC tree)
   to work properly, generated menu items must be enabled now (for containers and categories at a
   minimum; you'll be able to put these into a hidden menu, so they don't show anywhere). You might need
   to generate menu items for existing categories and/or nodes using the new category_resave module.

 * The fieldset for custom menu links creation on node edit forms is suppressed now, as it's incompatible
   with category_menu. Menu links should be created by either category_menu, or by the user - not both.
